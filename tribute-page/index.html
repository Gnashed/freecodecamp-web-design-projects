            <h3>Here's some interesting facts about coffee:</h3>

            <h4>Unknown Origin</h4>
            <p>
                Although there hasn't been any discovery in terms of where coffee originated from, there are stories in regions such as Ethiopia, The Arabian Peninsula,
                and parts of Europe that explains how coffee has been accidentally discovered, resulting in it's cultivation and trade.
            </p>

            <h4>Rapid Growth in Demand</h4>
            <p>
                As demand grew outside of the Arabian region, many regions around the world began cultivating the plant. Some areas succeeded, some failed. India failed in their efforts
                in the 17th century but succeeded once they started planting in Indonesia.
            </p>

            <h4>Attempts in Banning the Popular Beverage</h4>
            <p>
                Although the beverage became extremely popular, it did face criticism, especially from places such as Mecca and Italy during the 16th century.
                In 1511, Mecca banned the beverage since the government believed it "stimulated radical thinking and hanging out", which the governor thought 
                could cause opposition to their authority.
            </p>

            <h4>Present Date</h4>
            <p>
                Nowadays, coffee is still an extremely popular beverage where billions of cups are served daily around the world. In fact, here in the United States, Americans spend an average
                of about $1,100 a year on the beverage, according to the <a id="h4-p-a" href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/69146/16-quick-coffee-facts-national-coffee-day" 
                target="_blank">Mental Floss</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>A Struggling Industry</h4>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, coffee farmers are suffering due to them not being compensated fairly in terms of wages
                and the negative impacts from global warming. To counteract this, there has been a strong push in coffee culture that encourages fair wage practices to keeps
                the industry thriving. As a result of this, there are many coffee subscription services and even local/regional coffee roasters that support fair trade practices.
                Those practices entails farmers receiving fair prices, fair working conditions, environmental sustainability, direct trade, and community development.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Promoting Change</h4>
            <p>
                Coffee enthusiasts around the world can play their part by purchasing coffee from local or even regional coffee shops and roasteries. Just make sure those
                businesses are practicing the fair trade practices mentioned above.
